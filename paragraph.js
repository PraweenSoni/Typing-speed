    "AI and machine learning are related but not the same. AI is the broader term that refers to creating machines and systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence and abilities. Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on creating algorithms and models that can learn from data and improve their performance without explicit programming. Machine learning is one of the main methods to achieve AI, but not the only one. There are other branches of AI, such as logic, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, etc. that may or may not use machine learning techniques.",
    "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science that aims to create machines and systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence and abilities. AI can be applied to various domains, such as natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, gaming, healthcare, education, and more. AI can also be classified into different types, such as narrow AI, which is designed to perform a specific task, and general AI, which is capable of learning and reasoning across multiple domains. AI has many benefits and challenges, such as improving productivity, enhancing creativity, solving complex problems, but also raising ethical, social, and legal issues. AI is one of the most exciting and influential fields of the 21st century, and it has the potential to transform the world in many ways.",
    "Two common terms used to describe a salesperson are Farmer and Hunter. The reality is that most professional salespeople have a little of both. A hunter is often associated with aggressive personalities who use aggressive sales technique. In terms of sales methodology, a hunter refers to a person whose focus is on bringing in and closing deals. This process is called sales capturing. An example is a commodity sale such as a long distance salesperson, shoe salesperson and to a degree a car salesperson. Their job is to find and convert buyers. A sales farmer is someone who creates sales demand through activities that directly influence and alter the buying process."
